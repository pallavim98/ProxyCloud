SOCKET programming in python:

import socket

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

This line is used to create a  sockekt instance with parameter1: address family ip4 and parameter2: TCP protocol oriented connection


This socket is now usable to connect to a server
connection is possible only by knowing the ip of the server


How to find ip ?????

ip= socket.gethostbyname('www.google.com')
print ip


###An example script to connect to Google using socket is in the folder created -> socketver1.py


NOW how to send/recieve data from the server ???

We can send our data using the sendall() function from the socket library
Infact the server can send data back too

A simple client-server program:

1.A server has a bind() method which binds it to a specific ip and port so that it can listen to incoming requests on that ip and port.A server has a listen() method which puts the server into listen mode.

2.A server has an accept() and close() method. The accept method initiates a connection with the client and the close method closes the connection with the client.


###An example script has been created -> socketver2.py 

THE SERVER:

--> in thata file the s.listen(5) 5 here represents the fact that server here listens to 5 connnections at once when the server is busy
A 6th socket is refused to connect

--> The while loop is to accept all incominig connections andd close those connections after.

THE CLIENT:

USE THE TERMINAL TO CONNECT
