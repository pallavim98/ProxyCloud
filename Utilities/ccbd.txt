sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Ssh: Secure Shell --> bash:"born again shell"

generally we connect to a server using :
ssh<server ip> 

to connect to a locally hosted server we use : ssh < username> @localhost
NOTE : 127.0.0.1

~ : home directory

cat < ipfile : take ip from file
cat > opfile : put screen stuff onto a file

ls : list of files in file directory 
=> 
d : directory
rwx : read write execute

ps : processes list
kill <pid> : kill process with id pid

for a big code : if any process has been updated then there are dependencies 
BUT recompiling the entire file is a HEADACHE !!!

SO we keep a log of all files which are affected by the change in a MAKE file 
so we first run the make file -> make / make -f filename
